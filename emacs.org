** [[https://orgmode.org/manual/Refile-and-Copy.html][Refile and Copy]]
Instead of trying to copy and paste text around, these commands can be used to move entries within a file or between files.
*** org-refile
- =C-c C-w=
Refile the current entry or region
*** org-refile-copy
- =C-c M-w=
Works just like =org-refile= but the original note is not deleted.
*** Other Shortcuts
- =C-u C-c C-w=
  Use the refile interface to jump to a heading
- =C-u C-u C-c C-w=
  Jump to the location where org-refile last moved a tree to
** Folding
- S-Tab
  + cycle through folding options -- OVERVIEW, CONTENTS, SHOWALL
- [[https://orgmode.org/manual/Initial-visibility.html][Initial Visibility]]
  + Set the level of visibility when the file first opens. This defaults to =showeverything=.
** [[https://orgmode.org/manual/Timestamps.html#Timestamps][Timestamps]]
A timestamp can appear anywhere in the headline or body of an Org tree entry.
- Plain Timestamp
  + used for events or appointments
  + Example: <2006-11-01 Wed 19:15>
- Timestamp with repeater interval
  + Example: <2007-05-16 Wed 12:30 +1w>
- Time/Date range
  + Two timestamps connected by '--' denote a range.
  + Example: <2004-08-23 Mon>--<2004-08-26 Thu>
- Inactive Timestamp
  + Like a plain timestamp but they do not trigger an entry to show up in the agenda.
  + Example: [2006-11-01 Wed]
*** Creating Timestamps
- =C-c .=
  + Prompt for a date and insert a timestampt.
- =C-c !=
  + Insert an inactive timestamp
- =S-LEFT= or =S-RIGHT=
  + Change the date at point by one day
- =S-UP= or =S-DOWN=
  + If on the opening or closing brackets of the timestamp, change the type
  + Within the timestamp, change the item under the point
*** Deadlines and Scheduling
- =C-c C-d=
  + Insert DEADLINE along with a timestamp
- =C-c C-s=
  + Insert SCHEDULED with a timestamp
